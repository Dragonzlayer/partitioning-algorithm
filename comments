question about pseudo code of local search: if we've increased the search space and found a better solution,
do we need to try and improve this solution by the same search space? or to try and improve the solution by the small search space?

question2 what do you mean by file? is sending through a function good enough?

#TODO in local search - instead of greedy approach - check all possible transfers,
or maybe start by checking transfer to min_macine?

#TODO - check for max machine in max machines,
because when there is tie in sums the algo cannot improve if the
improvement can come from a machine that is not the first machine
because currently we can only improve the first machine

#TODO expand search space - move 2 jobs at a time and maintain an even numbers of jobs for every machine
